      <p>During my freshman year at my university, I implemented a
variant of prolog for a class project. I called it MSU Prolog at the
time, but it's not really a university endorsed project anymore so I
planned to just release the source so all could experiment with the
workings of a Prolog implementation. The code is written in Standard
ML, and the parser and lexer are home-brewed (now I'm mostly trying to
use lex and yacc like tools), but I think they make sense if you read
through them. The main code of the interpreter is actually only around
300 lines (see interpreter.ml)! The unification algorithm used is also
very simplistic (modern prolog implementations offer many shortcuts and
enhancements to exploit certain properties of Prolog). This was written
when I hadn't done a lot of ML for quite some time, and MLs still a
language I'm learning to use, so the code lacks an organized style, but
you might still find it interesting if you're working on a simmilar
project. The code is now released in the public domain. </p>
