<p>Welcome, all! To my corner of the web. On my website, you will
find various documents relating to math, computer science, and any
other things I find interesting.  I'm a PhD student at
the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu">University of Maryland, College
Park</a>, and I work with
the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/">PLUM people</a>.  My
broad interest is programming languages, specifically how we can
reason about programs to ensure or optimize properties of systems.</p>


<br><br>
<h3><b>Interests:</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>High order constructive logic. (<i>Small</i> things composed of <i>complex</i> ideas.)
  <li>SMT and SAT solving.
  <li>Formal methods and verification.
  <li>Systems (<i>Massive</i> things composed of <i>simple</i>, and occasionally complex, ideas.)
  <li>Drumming
  <li>Many others...
</ul>
<br>
<h3><b>Current projects</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>I've recently become interested in applying programming
  langauges concepts to scientific computation, where I postulate
  there will be many interesting problem domains with semantics that
  aren't well expressed by current programming languages.
  <li>I've been working on Android security for the past few months,
  you can see our progress in my <a href="/papers.html">papers</a>
  section.
</ul>

<h3><b>Older projects:</b></h3>
<ul>
  <li>For Spring 2012, I am the TA for
  the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2012/cmsc430/">undergraduate
  compilers class.</a>
  <li>For Fall 2011, I was the TA for CMSC 330, our undergraduate
  programming languages class.
</ul>

<p>Love the lambda,<br/>
