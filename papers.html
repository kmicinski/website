<h3><b>Android</b></h3>
<p>
The "Redexer" binary rewriter: Android apps use very coarse
permissions that allow them to access a very large set of system
resources without the user's knowledge.  Our thesis is that this is
because is that the permissions are <i>resource centric</i>
versus <i>semantic centric</i>.  (Example: an app requests access to
the internet rather than "cnn.com.")  We show that a solution to this
problem is to use Android's process separation to perform potentially
risky operations in a separate process, and interface to this trusted
deputy using RPC.  We also present a binary rewriter which can modify
apps "off the shelf" to retrofit existing Android apps to use our
enhanced security policies.

<p>The "Symdroid" symbolic executor: Symdroid is a symbolic executor
that works on native Dalvik code (without going to JVM code).  Our
draft for the Science of Computer Programming outlines our approach to
the construction of the symbolic executor.

<h3><b>Systems</b></h3>

<p>During my time at MSU, I worked with the
<a href="http://neews.egr.msu.edu/">NeEWS</a> lab in applications
related to wireless sensor networks.  I did mainly implementation
related things.
