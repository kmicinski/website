title: A little bit of code and humor

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>I don't have as much publicly available code as I'd like, but you
may feel free to check out
my <a href="https://github.com/kmicinski">public GitHub</a> for a
smattering of older projects and random snippets.</p>

<h3>Redexer</h3>
<p>Throughout 2011, I worked on a binary instrumentation framework for
Dalvik executables for Android bytecode rewriting.  Redexer is now
<a href="redexer">open source OCaml code</a> for all to use.

<h3>Much older...</h3>
<p>These are mostly much older projects from when I was a child...</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kmicinski/simpleturtlegraphics">A
  simple turtle graphics library for Java</a> &mdash; Written for the
  undergrad compilers class at MSU.
  <li><a href="msuprolog.html">MSU Prolog</a> &mdash; A tiny Prolog
      interpreter in ML.
  <li><a href="http://paperboy.sf.net">Paperboy</a> &mdash; An open
      source RSS news reader.
  <li><a href="https://github.com/kmicinski/GalSat">What a stupid
  idea</a> &mdah; A boolean satisfier based on genetic algorithms!
</ul>
