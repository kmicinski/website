title: Goals for the Fall 2012 semester

I haven't been very organized about doing things I really should be.
The grad school adjustment was slightly stressful, and (although I
still haven't done any super hardcore work yet) I'm mostly ready now
to really start into a new life here in grad school.  Around this time
last year I actually felt pretty stressed: new adjustments, trying to
figure out what "research" meant, trying to understand what "classes"
were, and finding new friends (I have a lot of great ones now!).

Big picture goals for the semester
----------------------------------

- Write a paper completely on my own that constitutes some nontrivial
  amount of work (i.e., a conference paper, not workshop).  I've been
  second or third author on a few interesting(-ish) projects now, but
  my colleagues most definitely did the majority of the work
  (especially [Jinseong](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jsjeon/))..

- I'd like to lose five pounds this semester.  I've started to develop
  bad eating habits, in the sense that I occasionally when I'm *not
  even hungry*.  This sort of works for now, because I (honestly) have
  a pretty "okay" metabolism.  The point is that right now I don't
  need the kind of food that I buy routinely.  I spend a fair amount
  of money on bar food.

- Plan a budget for food, and a schedule of what to eat on a daily
  basis.

- Write up a [Yesod](yesodweb.com) based web service to manage my
  research.  The motivation for this *isn't* that there aren't good
  programs to do this out there already, there are.  I even use a few
  of them for keeping track of citations.  However, I really need the
  excuse to learn.

- Become overall a little more mature person.  I still act pretty
  compulsive and am rarely serious (in fact, I would guess most people
  would predict that I take nothing seriously) when not discussing
  things I think are relevant.. I'd like to continue trying to improve
  this.

- Understand coinduction.

- Understand delimited control better.

- I've become part of the [Internet Hosting Cooperative]().  I'd like
  to figure out their language (a domain specific and type safe
  language for writing server configurations for your account on their
  system) and then actually use it to host my own web apps.

- Make at least one A in my classes.

Things I'm going to do every day
--------------------------------

Certain things I really want to do every day, in small chunks.

- I want to do 30 push ups every day.  I plan to do 15 in the morning
  and 15 in the evening.

- Learn one random thing about [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/).

- Walk or bike an equivalent distance back and forth from campus.

- Never take the stairs.

- Sit down and actually read about classes or homework for two hours.
  I'd prefer to dedicate the time between eight and ten every night to
  work on this (on the weeknights).

- Go to sleep by 1AM every weeknight.

- Wake up by 9AM every weekday.

- On weeknights, drink no caffeine after 3PM.  Caffeine really seems
  to affect me, and I can't go to sleep at all when I drink it, in a
  bad way.

Things I'm going to do every week
---------------------------------

To make these goals a bit more realistic, I'm going to do only certain
things every week. I all too often try to learn everything at once,
and it ends up working out badly (i.e., I learn nothing).  I'd like to
limit the scope and try to focus on really getting stuff done.

- Write one large blog post every week summarizing an idea,
  implementation, tutorial, etc...

- Write two smaller blog entries, relating to pretty much anything.

- Work through one of Adam Chlipala's chapters in the
  [CPDT](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/).  Yes, I sort of did this
  throughout this summer while leading a reading group on Coq.  The
  group was pretty helpful.

- Read a chapter in the [Haskell web book on category
  theory.](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/User:Michiexile/MATH198)
  I try to dig into category theory once in a while, but have no real
  compelling use for it.  I suspect this time will be no different

- Do something somewhat adventuresome by myself in the DC area.

- Learn about one new monad in the Haskell standard library.

- Read one significant paper (within a historical context) relating to
  my field.  I'd like to get a better understanding of category
  theory, type inference, type theory (aka, the more foundational
  aspects of the calculus of constructions, or whatever), and a bunch
  of other small things.

- Buy a record.

Things I'd like to do every month
---------------------------------

- Fork a new Haskell project on Github, read it, and contribute a
  nontrivial change.

- Write up some largeish explanation (in the form of a tutorial) on
  something.

- Lead a discussion in our lab's reading group.  Generally this will
  entail really reading a paper, and then also writing a presentation
  about it, then talking about it.
