This is my first post on my new website!  It's sort of a test post,
but I plan to write a longer one later, along with a tutorial about
using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) to produce clean looking
academic websites.  It's a pretty fun little system, and simple enough
to use after learning a bit about arrows and Haskell.
