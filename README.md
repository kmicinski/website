Kris' website
=============

This website uses [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) to generate a
static website, with a few JavaScript extensions to make things flash
and bang.

You should be able to do a simple

    ghc --make hakyll.hs

Provided you have hakyll installed (`cabal install hakyll`).

The configuration is in `hakyll.hs`, and `./hakyll build` will build
the site.
