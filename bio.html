<p> I first ventured into programming fairly young in life. This was
not, of course, uncommon for young programmers in the 90s, and indeed
a whole swarm of today's programmers started with the same Linux
distribution and book on C programming as I. After that, I've been
having as much as fun as possible solving interesting problems,
writing in crazy languages, talking about math for long stretches of
time, and playing a lot of the drums (not to mention, spending too
much on cymbals).

<p> After working on writing HTML pages for a while, I wondered what
it might be like to write in Perl and control what went on "behind the
scenes." I understand now that I learned programming backward: as I
started with HTML, Perl, Basic (but just for a few days!), C, C++,
Java, etc... I finally moved on to the newer collection of functional
languages like Haskell, ML, OCaml, F#, and the related others. I have
written in many languages and in many situations: from web based
database driven applications, down to compilers for simplistic
multicycle microcontrollers (the 68HC12, in that case). Eventually, I
aspire to research and develop programming languages, especially those
with richer type systems and more expressive (safer?) semantics. My
main academic interests (besides languages) include computer
architecture and systems.

<p> I spent my younger years in a small town in north Texas, but moved
to East Lansing, Michigan to attend college.  I recently finished a
degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from MSU by patching
together a number of classes in a variety of subjects.  While at MSU I
was employed by the NeEWS laboratory, working on a variety of
applications relating to sensor networks and mobile routing problems.
The day to day activities consisted of programming in low level C code
that runs on mobile sensor nodes, along with higher level code mainly
written in Java.  For the last year there I worked on a prototype of a
publish subscribe wireless distribution system implemented on the
Android platform (and I continue to do Android development from time
to time).  My coursework at MSU consisted mainly of computer science,
a bit of electrical engineering, and a little bit of math.

After my second year at MSU I worked as an intern at Microsoft, where
I worked on prototyping a domain specific language for user mode
interrupt handling with the Windows Driver Foundation team.  I still
think this is a nice example of where PL ideas can be used to solve
real problems, and I'd like to keep this spirit in my future research.

I now reside
in <a href="http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Hollywood-College-Park-MD.html">Hollywood</a>,
and work in programming languags research with
the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/">PLUM</a> people.
(<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jfoster/">Jeff Foster</a>
and <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/">Mike Hicks</a> are excellent
researchers and teachers, and I would reccomend any prospective PL
students to apply to UMD!)  I spend most of my time listening to
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4sa2HoXpsE&ob=av2e">The
Weepies</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxFxl-EgUYw">The

Crows</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIPrJmzG7Ss">Marillion</a>,
fighting with TeX, Coq, and emacs, teaching undergrads about PL,
tracking down bugs, reading papers (oh geeze, need to do more of that
one), and thinking about how to make my desk more fasshionable.
